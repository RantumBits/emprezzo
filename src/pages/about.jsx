    We seeks to connect consumers directly with excpetional independent brands & retailers. Large platforms control an increasingly large share of transactions, while local retailers and small independent comnpanies have struggled to survive.
</p>  <p>
    Platforms are convenient and great for deliveing basic goods. They are not good for find discovering the very best products; they reward 'good enough' over 'great', take a large percentage of sales, and often promote their own substandard brands.
</p>  <p>
    We've created an easily-searchable list of exceptional brands and retailers where you can shop directly. As a consumer you can generally expect the same prices as on major platforms, additional incentives for shopping directly, and support great independent brands
</p>  <p>
    The list of shops is intended to grow over time, as is the functionality of the site. New submissions are always welcome.
